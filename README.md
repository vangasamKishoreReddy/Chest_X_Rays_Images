# 🩻 Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification Web App

An interactive **Streamlit web application** for classifying chest X-ray images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia** using a **ResNet-50 deep learning model**, with **Grad-CAM visualizations**, **feature descriptors (ORB & SIFT)**, and performance metrics.

## 🚀 Demo Features

- ✅ Upload X-ray images and receive real-time predictions
- 📊 Visualize Grad-CAM heatmaps highlighting critical lung regions
- 🧠 Includes handcrafted features (ORB, SIFT) for interpretability
- 📈 Live performance evaluation: confusion matrix, classification report
- 🖼️ Explore dataset samples with class breakdowns
- 📂 Integrated test, train, validation data loader
- 🧠 Built with PyTorch, OpenCV, Streamlit, and torchvision
